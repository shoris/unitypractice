# unitypractice
proof of concept/practice for a 2D, top-down, turn-based JRPG. wonky scene changes and current lack of inventory. there are also a number of unused scripts.

things demonstrated here:
- dialogue manager/scrolling dialogue
- turn-based battle state machine
- persistent data using GameInformation object

used a bunch of YouTube tutorials for inspiration and initial study, mostly HardlyBriefProgramming and GamesPlusJames.

art comes from here: https://opengameart.org/content/zelda-like-tilesets-and-sprites
